# 🧠 FLask_API – Roشtaa NLP Backend

This repository contains the **NLP & Flask API backend** of my graduation project **Roشtaa**, a mobile application designed to assist with medical prescriptions and drug recommendations.  

The API provides **text extraction, natural language processing, and drug information services** that connect directly with the Roشtaa mobile app.

## 🚀 Features
- 📝 **OCR (Tesseract-OCR)** → Extracts text from prescription images.  
- 🔍 **NLP Pipeline (NLTK, Scikit-learn, Joblib)** → Processes extracted text to identify drugs, dosage, and recommendations.  
- 💊 **Drug Knowledge Base** → Uses `drugs.txt` for drug name matching and validation.  
- 🌐 **RESTful Flask API** → Easy integration with the Roشtaa mobile app.
